# MLB Season Comparer

This simple tool will allow you find win streak comparisons among MLB seasons.
Simply build the program in golang, and run the `compare` command
(self-documented).

The CSV input data should follow for the format of the [mlb.csv](mlb.csv) file
included. You can find a google spreadsheet with fake, generated data in the
correct format [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12fHDfd7KYtpmftfXJJqFwrb51cSbFM2xfR6SktW0eFs/edit?usp=sharing).
